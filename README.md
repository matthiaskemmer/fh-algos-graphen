# Task 3 GRAPHEN - Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen (ALGOS)

Group project for second semester course "Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen" (ALGOS) at FH Technikum Wien.

Authors: Matthias Kemmer, Li Wen Wang

## Task
The task was to create a programm which searchs the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The graph uses the Vienna's public transport station data as example data. There are two verions of finding the shortest path implemented. The first one (find_path) is Dijkstra's algorithm without min-heap priority queue and the second one (find_path_heapq) is the optimized/faster one using a min-heap priority queue.
